  Our project allows you to play a game of draw-one Klondike Solitaire to 
  completion. It prints an easy-to-understand visual depiction of all 
  components of the game, including the stock, foundation, and tableau. Users 
  play by entering moves through terminal, which are executed if and only if 
  they are legal.
  
  Additional features may include variants such as draw-three, a cheat mode, 
  an easy mode, customizable colors and decks, and audio feedback.
