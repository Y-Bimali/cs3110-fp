The STOCK is in the upper left.
The FOUNDATION is in the upper right.
The TABLEAU is the seven columns at the bottom. 
To WIN the game, you must build up stacks from Ace to King of each suit on The
    FOUNDATION.

You can flip through the STOCK with draw, and move the topmost card on the WASTE
    to the FOUNDATION or TABLEAU. If the STOCK is empty and draw is performed,
    all cards on the WASTE will be returned to the STOCK. 

On the TABLEAU, a card can only be placed on another card if it is one index 
    below and the opposite color. Only a King can be placed on an empty column. 
    Multiple cards can be moved at the same time if they are all visible.

On the FOUNDATION, a card can only be placed on another if it is one index above
    and the same suit. Only an Ace can be placed on an empty column.
